# PrincePal
*Preview your PDFs like a prince!*

**Before you begin:**
* Install **Python 3.8.2** or higher on your machine. See [Properly Installing Python](https://docs.python-guide.org/starting/installation/).
* Install **Prince** on your machine. See [Prince - Getting Started](https://www.princexml.com/doc/installing/).
* Begin developing a Prince PDF style. See [Your First Document](https://www.princexml.com/doc/first-doc/).

**Procedure:**
1. Put **PrincePal** in the directory where you keep the HTML files that you want to convert to PDFs.  
**TIP:** Ensure that the HTML files do not contain any broken references because they greatly slow conversion down.
1. Do one of the following:
    * To convert HTML files in the **PrincePal** directory to PDFs and open preview, run **PrincePal**.  
    **NOTE:** Every PDF file opens in the default application determined by your OS settings. I recommend setting a web browser (e.g. Chrome or Brave) to open PDFs by default in your OS settings. This way, each time you run **PrincePal**, a new tab opens so you can quickly compare your styling modifications.
    * To convert HTML files in the **PrincePal** directory to PDFs, run **PrincePal** with the *--no_preview* attribute.
    * **USE WITH CAUTION:** To remove every PDF file in the **PrincePal** directory, run **PrincePal** with the *--remove_pdfs* attribute.
    * To set the number of concurrent jobs, run **PrincePal** with the *--concurrent_jobs* attribute.  
    **NOTE:** The number of concurrent conversion, removal, and preview jobs defaults to 12. You can use this attribute with other attributes.
