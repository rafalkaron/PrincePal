# PrinceXML Preview
*Preview your PDFs like a prince!*

**Before you begin:**
* Install **Python 3.x** on your machine. See [Properly Installing Python](https://docs.python-guide.org/starting/installation/)
* Install **Prince** on your machine. See [Prince - Getting Started](https://www.princexml.com/doc/installing/)
* In a directory, create an **HTML** file and a **CSS** file. See [Your First Document](https://www.princexml.com/doc/first-doc/).

**Procedure:**
1. Put **PrinceXML Preview** in the **HTML** file directory.
1. Run **PrinceXML Preview**.

**Results:**
* Prince converts every HTML file in the **PrinceXML Preview** directory to a PDF file.
* Every PDF file opens in the default application determined by your OS settings.  
**Note:** I recommend setting a web browser (e.g. Chrome or Brave) to open PDFs by default in your OS settings. This way, each time you run **PrinceXML Preview**, a new tab opens enabling you to quickly compare your styling modifications.
